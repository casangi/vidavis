Visualization Applications
=============================

.. currentmodule:: applications

This section will describe the visualization applications in the
:code:`vidavis` package. The application development targets a number of
:ref:`usage settings <design-usage-settings>` as described in the
:ref:`System Design <design-system-design>` section. The goal is for a single
codebase to have the flexibility to support users in a number of very different
settings. This is only possible due to powerful frameworks like :xref:`electron`
and :xref:`bokeh`.
