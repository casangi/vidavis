Visibility Data Visualization
=============================

The :code:`vidavis` (VIsibility DAta VISualization) package provides graphical
user interfaces to replace the :xref:`casa` MeasurementSet visibility plotters.
This new generation of interfaces, which are implemented in Python, will be
based on :xref:`bokeh` and will use web browsers for display.

There are two basic documentation sections. The primary section describes the
applications that are provided by :code:`vidavis`. The second section describes
the motivation, the design and the long term goals of :code:`vidavis`.
